2. I certify that, to the best of my knowledge, {{to}} is not supporting initiation of violence against others.
3. I have disclosed any contractual terms & conditions with respect to {{quantity}} to {{to}}.

I understand that funds transfers are not reversible after the {{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured by {{from}}'s permissions.
